## Overview

Typical issues during monitoring and discovery include unreachable devices, incorrect or outdated SNMP/Agent credentials, and blocked network ports. These problems prevent the NetGain server from collecting data or identifying devices on the network.

## Steps to resolve

1. Verify that the device responds to `ping` from the NetGain server.
2. Confirm SNMP or agent services are running and accessible.
3. Doubleâ€‘check community strings or authentication details.
4. Ensure firewalls allow required ports such as UDP 161 for SNMP.
5. Rerun the discovery wizard and review logs for errors.
6. Use `snmpwalk` or similar tools to verify a device responds correctly.
