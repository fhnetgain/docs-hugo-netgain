The administrator will create and manage accounts for the user.
  
The administrator can assign a client IP address (or IP address segment) for each user, enhancing security as an authorized user would require a client IP address as well as a username and password to successfully log in.

Accounts consists of four modules:

* <a href="/cloud_vista/sysadmin/admin/accounts/roles">Creation and management of Roles</a>
* <a href="/cloud_vista/sysadmin/admin/accounts/users">Creation and management of Users</a>
* <a href="/cloud_vista/sysadmin/admin/accounts/accesscontrol">Access Control rules</a>
* <a href="/cloud_vista/sysadmin/admin/accounts/myprofile">Change of My Profile</a>
