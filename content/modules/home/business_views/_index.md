The {{% company %}} console supports Business View, which is an easy-to-use administrative function that integrates all IT components into one comprehensive framework, transforming the IT infrastructure into a business service.

Business View helps overcome problems in developing an effective Service Level Agreement (SLA), allowing service quality, monitoring methods and report generation parameters to be set. Services can include network interfaces, system performance, databases, web services and standard TCP/UDP ports.

Business View sets the framework for using an XML-based, object-oriented model that defines:
* Client services
* Service dependencies
* Service monitoring
* SLA rules and threshold parameters for service monitoring

A typical business framework follows, where an organization can own many services and sub-services, with each relying on one or more monitors. Each monitor has a series of SLA standards and threshold parameters.
