This feature serves as a tool for network architecture visualization, focusing on both Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and Layer 3 (Network Layer). It displays the interconnections within the network, highlighting the routes that data packets follow from source to destination across potentially intricate and multi-layered network paths.

A key technical aspect of this function is its incorporation of network discovery methods. It employs protocols such as the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), and Huawei Discovery Protocol (HDP). These protocols grant the function the ability to navigate and map the elaborate interconnections within the network, revealing both all links, including the hidden ones.

The function also features an automatic layout mechanism, which presents the complex network topology in a structured and digestible format. Beyond merely offering a static view, the function allows for user-driven customization of the layouts based on specific needs or preferences. These custom views can be preserved for later use, facilitating a more efficient understanding, management, and troubleshooting of network systems.

In summary, this function delivers a comprehensive and user-adaptable approach to network visualization, combining advanced discovery protocols with customizable views. It provides users with the necessary tools to navigate and comprehend the complexities of their network's architecture, thereby enhancing their ability to manage and troubleshoot their systems effectively.
