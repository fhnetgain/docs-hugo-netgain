You can integrate the alerts generated with your existing OpsGenie, Pager Duty or Service Now ticketing apps. Refer to the appropriate documentation for information on setting up this integration.

OpsGenie – uses API key for integration  (https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/api-integration)

Pager Duty – uses API key, Service ID and User Email ID for integration (https://www.pagerduty.com/sign-up/) 

Service Now – uses URL, Username and Password for integration

**Note**: This plug-in uses Basic Authentication with the ServiceNow REST API, so you would need a valid username and password
