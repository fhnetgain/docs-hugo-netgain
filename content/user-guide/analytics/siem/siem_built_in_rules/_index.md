# Concise Use Cases for SIEM: Convincing Customers of Its Value
 
Our SIEM provides a comprehensive suite of built-in detection rules and use cases that align with key cybersecurity challenges organizations face today. These are designed to proactively detect and respond to threats across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments. Hereâ€™s how our SIEM can add value to your organization:
 
## 1. Threat Detection and Response
 
* Detect **malicious activities** such as ransomware, phishing, and unauthorized access attempts.
* Identify **anomalous behaviors** like privilege escalation, suspicious process execution, or lateral movement across your environment.
* Monitor for **command-and-control activity** and data exfiltration using tools like PowerShell, SSH, or web shells.
 
## 2. Insider Threat Monitoring
 
* Track changes to sensitive configurations like **policy modifications, credential dumping, and user account creations**.
* Detect suspicious user behavior, such as **unusual file deletions, account privilege escalations, or excessive data downloads**.
 
## 3. Cloud Security and Compliance
 
* Protect cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and Google Workspace by monitoring:
* **Unauthorized API activities and sensitive data access**.
* Changes to **IAM roles, firewall rules, or cloud storage configurations**.
* Identify privilege abuse and detect risky actions like key regeneration, suspicious mailbox delegations, or MFA bypasses.
 
## 4. Endpoint and Application Security
 
* Detect malware and unauthorized file creation with rules covering:
* **Reverse shells, persistence mechanisms, and tampering with security tools**.
* Monitor application-level threats like exploitation via Microsoft Office macros, kernel modifications, or unauthorized remote connections.
 
## 5. Container and Kubernetes Security
 
* Identify security gaps in containerized environments with alerts for:
* Privileged pods, hostPath access, and sensitive configuration changes.
* Misconfigured workloads that enable lateral movement or privilege escalation.
 
## 6. Vulnerability Management
 
* Detect exploitation of known vulnerabilities such as **CVE-2023-38545 or CVE-2023-4911** before attackers can take advantage.
* Proactively track the deployment of suspicious binaries and scripts.
 
## 7. Regulatory Compliance and Auditing
 
* Enforce compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS through:
* Comprehensive logging and monitoring of **privileged activities and security policy changes.**
* Visibility into sensitive system activities like **shadow copy deletions, tampering with event logs, or file encryption**.
 
## Summary of Benefits
 
With its extensive library of detection rules, our SIEM ensures that you:
* **Stay ahead of evolving threats** with real-time alerts and actionable insights.
* Reduce dwell time with **quick detection and response** to potential incidents.
* Gain visibility across your hybrid environments, including endpoints, applications, cloud services, and containers.
* Simplify compliance by automatically tracking and logging critical activities.
 
By adopting our SIEM, your organization will have the tools necessary to identify and mitigate risks proactively, ensuring a secure, compliant, and resilient IT environment.
