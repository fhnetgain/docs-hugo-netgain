Maps provides a pictorial representation of the devices that are being monitored, showing their status and their location. This allows organizations to better understand and manage their devices in a specific location or network.

The Maps function can be accessed by clicking on \<Home> in the Left Navigation Bar, then \<Maps> in the Top Navigation Bar.
