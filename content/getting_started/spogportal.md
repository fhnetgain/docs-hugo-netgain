# Solution Architecture

{{% company %}} is the cloud data and analytics platform for data normalization, processing, visualization and report generation. It integrates and sends alerts to trouble-ticketing systems, and collaboration and messaging systems.

When you sign up for an account, a unique and dedicated {{% company %}} instance is created for you.  

Emedge is deployed within the enterprise network either on-prem, public or private cloud, or in a hybrid infrastructure. Emedge is a thin software that collects IT infrastructure data. Such data includes device metrics, logs, and traces, from on-prem, cloud and hybrid infrastructure. Emedge forwards the data via an encrypted link to {{% company %}}.

Emedge uses open protocols to collect data from all IT systems. Common protocols include SNMP, JDBC, Elastic Beats and others.  

With {{% company %}} and emedge working together, the user has a full observability to their infrastructure, whether it is on-prem, in the cloud, or hybrid.
