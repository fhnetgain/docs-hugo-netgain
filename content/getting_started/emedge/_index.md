# About emedge
**emedge** is a software that runs on your local site. It collects metrics and logics from the IT network and hosts (with **emedge-agent** installed) and sends them to CloudVista, where you can analyze and visualize your monitoring and performance data. You only need to deploy an instance of emedge per local site.
